===========
I sell stickers on A4 sheets which is of the dimention 205mmx260mm.
I get a lot of customers asking how many stickers can I get on a "specific dimensions" sheet.
Write JavaScript function where one can enter length and width of a sheet and it will calculate how many they can fit on a page and diplay and display a sheet in HTML using grid or flexbox that will display the stickers in a grid and show the dimensions of the sheet and the dimensions of the stickers.

The useable space on the sheet for customer designs is 205mm x 260mm I always have to allow a 2mm border on all designs and a 2mm space between each logo The shapes are always either square or rectangular.
